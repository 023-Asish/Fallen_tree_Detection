# Fallen_tree_Detection
This project mainly assists the city concern authorities in detecting
whether a tree is broken and blocking the road. Due to the storm or other
reasons, a tree may fall on the road. It can block the entire route and may
cause severe inconvenience to the people. This situation can create a big
issue for transportation, ambulance patients, broken electric wires, etc. So
as soon as our application detects any fallen tree, it will notify the
concerned authorities, and they will instantly take action.
